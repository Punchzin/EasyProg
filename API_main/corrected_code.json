    "corrected_code": "The bug in this code is that you are trying to concatenate a string with an integer, which is not allowed in Python. You need to convert the integer to a string before concatenating. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nname = \"John\"\nage = 25\nprint(\"My name is \" + name + \" and I am \" + str(age) + \" years old.\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use formatted string literals (f-strings) to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nname = \"John\"\nage = 25\nprint(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n```"
